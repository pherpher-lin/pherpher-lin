## About Me 

Hello, I'm Chris. Data Analyst with a specialty in visualizing data
I’m motivated by building technical solutions that transform raw data into clear, meaningful insights. I work with Python, SQL, and Tableau to analyze datasets, automate manual processes, and deliver clean, organized outputs that support decision-making. I enjoy developing dashboards, cleaning large datasets, and structuring data workflows that improve accuracy and efficiency. Whether documenting processes, validating data, or creating metrics that inform product development, I focus on building reliable, well-structured solutions. I’m especially interested in growing within analytical, data-focused roles where I can solve problems and contribute to impactful, data-driven outcomes.
